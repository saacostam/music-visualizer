# Music Visualizer 🎵

Music Visualizer is a website that uses the AnalyserNode from JavaScript Audio API to create a 3-band frequency-based visualization. 
It enables the user to set their own parameters and select from a range of preloaded songs. 
It was built as a personal project to learn the Canvas API.
